User Testing Summary (3 Peers)
As part of the usability evaluation, I conducted informal user testing with three peers who used the MindBalance Wellness application. 
Each participant was asked to complete three tasks:
1.	Navigate between pages using the top menu
2.	Submit a new entry using the Form page
3.	View the saved entry on the Data page

Peer Feedback Highlights:
- Peer 1: "This is clean. I like how simple the layout is.it doesn’t feel overwhelming.The loading message on the Data page definitely helped because at 
first I thought something was wrong, but then I saw it loading."

- Peer 2: "The form was straightforward. I typed something in and hit submit no confusion at all. The spacing and input boxes look professional."

- Peer 3: “The form was simple. I submitted an entry and it submitted nothing really big.”

Performance Testing (Before Optimization)
**Home Page**
- DOMContentLoaded: 108 ms
- Load/Finish: 171 ms

**Data Display Page**
- GET Request Time: 54 ms

**Form Page**
- GET Request Time: 44 ms
- POST Request Time: 27 ms

Performance Testing (After Optimization)
**Home Page**
- DOMContentLoaded:215 ms

**Data Display Page**
- GET Request Time: 10 ms

**Form Page**
- GET Request Time: 47 ms
- POST Request Time: 18-19 ms

Improvement #1: Added Loading State to DataDisplayPage
Before optimization, the data page attempted to render content immediately while the API request was still pending. This caused layout shifts, blank screen flashes, and 
unnecessary re-renders while React waited for the data to finish loading. By adding a dedicated loading state, the page now displays a “Loading…” message until the data is fully received. T

Impact:
•	Faster perceived load time
•	Cleaner UI
•	Reduced re-render count

Improvement #2: Memoized Navigation Component Using React.memo()
Previously, the Navigation component re-rendered every time any page’s state updated (such as when submitting a form or fetching data). 
Since the navigation bar never changes, these re-renders were unnecessary and wasted computation. By wrapping the Navigation component in React.memo(), 
React now re-renders it only when its props change — which does not occur in this application. 

Impact:
•	Fewer component re-renders
•	Faster transitions
•	Reduced CPU work in development
•	Better performance consistency
